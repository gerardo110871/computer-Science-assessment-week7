    According to the results in the graph, unshift is a lot faster at smaller scales vs push, but

as the array gets bigger the push method is more efficient than the unshift method. This is because

with unshift the array has to re-arrange all the elements by shifting them vs where push is just adding, but

not manipulating the rest of the array.
